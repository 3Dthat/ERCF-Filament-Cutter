This is a filament cutter to LGX Lite and Sherpa Mini extruders. I have been using it on Dragon Burner. https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner

You need to super glue the #11, Exacto Knife Replacement Blade into the Blade_Holder_Bottom.stl

For the LGX Lite you need:
2 x m3x8 to bolt the LGX_Lite_Cutter_Top.stl to the extruder.
2 x m3x40 to bolt the assembly to the Dragon Burner

For the Sherpa Mini you need:
2 x m3x40 to bolt the assembly to the Dragon Burner

Credits go to these 2 guys for starting this project. I took it and cleaned it up and made it work for the LGX Lite as well. I also fixed the cutter hitting the sherpa mini extruder.
